### Ajax Movies
* movies fetching using javascript

## Summary

The students will create a **new** movies app to allow users to search the database of movies.

## Specification
Instead of returning a single title, the OMDb API allows you t do a search which will return multiple titles.

For example if you search on Jaws, you will get a list like the following:

* Jaws
* Jaws 2
* Jaws 3-D
* Jaws Special
* Jaws Wired Shut

write a frontend app to allow users to enter a search for movies, and to show the list of title within h2 tags without page refresh.

- index.html
- app.js
- style.css

### Extension

turn each h2 titles into a link that goes to the corresponding IMDB movie page that opens in a new window
